# rinth

For now simply a parser of PDDL.

The goal is at some point to make it into a grounded planner, however, that is on a standstill.

## Building
To build the executable, simply run the following:
```
make build
```
The resulting executable will then be found in ./build/

## Tests
To run tests, simply run the following:
```
make test
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The tests require [Criterion](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion). As such, it is required to be installed on the system. This is not automatic.
